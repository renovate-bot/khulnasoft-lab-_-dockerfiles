pandoc Dockerfiles
================================================================================

This repo contains a collection of Dockerfiles to build various
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) container images.

Available Images
==================================================================

Docker images hosted here have the following variants:

- minimal: kept as small as possible. See the [pandoc/minimal][]
  repository.
- core: suitable for common conversion tasks; includes additional
  libraries and programs. See the [pandoc/core][] repository.
- latex: builds on top of the core image, and provides a basic
  LaTeX installation in addition. This includes all packages that
  `pandoc` _might_ use, and any libraries needed by these
  packages. See the [pandoc/latex][] repository.
- extra: extends the latex image with a curated selection of templates,
  filters, fonts, etc. See the [pandoc/extra][] repository.

All images are based on the `alpine` stack. The [pandoc/minimal][],
[pandoc/latex][] and [pandoc/extra][] images are also available with 
an `ubuntu` stack.

Usage
================================================================================

> **Note**: this section describes how to use the docker images.  Please refer
> to the [`pandoc` manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for usage information
> about `pandoc`.

Docker images are pre-provisioned computing environments, similar to virtual
machines, but smaller and cleverer. You can use these images to convert document
wherever you can run docker images, without having to worry about pandoc or its
dependencies. The images bring along everything they need to get the job done.

Basic Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) if you don't have it already.

2. Start up Docker. Usually you will have an application called "Docker" on your
   computer with a rudimentary graphical user interface (GUI). You can also run
   this command in the command-line interface (CLI):

   ```sh
   open -a Docker
   ```

3. Open a shell and navigate to wherever the files are that you want to convert.

   ```sh
   cd path/to/source/dir
   ```

   You can always run `pwd` to check whether you're in the right place.

4. [Run docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) by entering the
   below commands in your favorite shell.

   Let's say you have a `README.md` in your working directory that you'd like to
   convert to HTML.

   ```sh
   docker run --rm --volume "`pwd`:/data" --user `id -u`:`id -g` pandoc/latex:2.6 README.md
   ```

   The `--volume` flag maps some directory on *your machine* (lefthand side of
   the colons) to some directory *in the container* (righthand side), so that
   you have your source files available for pandoc to convert. `pwd` is quoted
   to protect against spaces in filenames.

   Ownership of the output file is determined by the user executing pandoc *in
   the container*. This will generally be a user different from the local user.
   It is hence a good idea to specify for docker the user and group IDs to use
   via the `--user` flag.

   `pandoc/latex:2.6` declares the image that you're going to run. It's always a
   good idea to hardcode the version, lest future releases break your code.

   It may look weird to you that you can just add `README.md` at the end of this
   line, but that's just because the `pandoc/latex:2.6` will simply prepend
   `pandoc` in front of anything you write after `pandoc/latex:2.6` (this is
   known as the `ENTRYPOINT` field of the Dockerfile). So what you're really
   running here is `pandoc README.md`, which is a valid pandoc command.

   If you don't have the current docker image on your computer yet, the
   downloading and unpacking is going to take a while. It'll be (much) faster
   the next time. You don't have to worry about where/how Docker keeps these
   images.

GitHub Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub Actions is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) from GitHub that allows
you to automatically run code on GitHub's servers on every push (or a bunch of
other GitHub events).

 Such continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) may be useful for many pandoc
 users. Perhaps, you're using pandoc convert some markdown source document into HTML and deploy the results to a webserver. If the source document is under
 version control (such as git), you might want pandoc to convert and deploy
 *on every commit*. That is what CI/CD does.

To use pandoc on GitHub Actions, you can leverage the docker images of this
project.

workflow, see
[these examples](http://github.com/maxheld83/pandoc-action-example).

Building custom images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The official images are bare-bones, providing everything required to use pandoc
and Lua filters, but not much more. Often, one will want to have additional
software available.  This is best achieved by building custom Docker images.

For example, one may want to use advanced spellchecking as demonstrated in the
[spellcheck] in the Lua filters collection. This requires the *aspell* package
as well as language-specific packages. A good solution would be to define a new
Dockerfile and to use `pandoc/core` as the base package:

``` Dockerfile
FROM pandoc/core:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add aspell aspell-en aspell-fr
```

Create a new image by running `docker build --tag=pandoc-with-aspell .` in the
directory containing the Dockerfile. Now you can use `pandoc-with-aspell`
instead of `pandoc/core` to get access to spellchecking in your image.

See Docker documentation for more details, for example [part 2 of the Get
Started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).

### Internationalized LaTeX images

This very method can be used to create images with support for
additional fonts. This is of particular importance for the processing of
documents written in a language that uses non-Latin characters.

Below is an example Dockerfile that can be used to build a custom image with
support for Ukrainian. It adds the necessary LaTeX packages via `tlmgr` and
installs *Linux Libertine* as a font with support for Cyrillic.

``` Dockerfile
FROM pandoc/latex
RUN tlmgr install babel-ukrainian
RUN apk --no-cache add font-linux-libertine
```

After building a new image as described in the previous section, the
image can then be used to convert documents such as:

``` markdown
---
title: "Приклад українською"
mainfont: Linux Libertine
lang: uk
---

```
